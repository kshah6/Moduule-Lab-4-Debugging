# Moduule-Lab-4-Debugging
In this lab activity there were 7 programs which had errors and we had to find and fix the errors and test the program so it runs without any problem.
Program 1 greets the user if from past, present or future. Program 2 prints the collection of authors. Program 3 calculates students average grade. Progarm 4 greets the user if password is correct. Progarm 5 prints hello. Program 6 calculates the final waiting time. Program 7 sets the alarm from intial time + the wait time
